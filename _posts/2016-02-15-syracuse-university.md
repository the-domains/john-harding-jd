description: "For the first time, scientists, including those at Syracuse University, have observed ripples in the fabric of spacetime called gravitational waves, arriving at the earth from a cataclysmic event in the distant universe. This confirms a major prediction of Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity, and opens an unprecedented new window onto the cosmos."

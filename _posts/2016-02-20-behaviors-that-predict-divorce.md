description: 'Stonewalling, contempt, criticism, and defensiveness. According to psychologists at the University of Washington and the University of California, these four behavior traits in married couples indicate a strong likelihood of divorce. When the psychologists added questions about things like relationship satisfaction and how many times the research subjects had thoughts about separating to the mix, they could predict which marriages would end in divorce 93% of the time.'
